## Description for each component in React Native:

1. **View**: The View component is a fundamental building block in React Native, akin to a <div>  in web development. It structures and styles UI components, allowing nesting of other Views or UI elements like Text and Image.

2. **Text**: Displaying text is essential, and the Text component serves this purpose in React Native. Think of it as a <span> or <p> equivalent. You can style Text using properties like fontSize, color, and fontWeight.

3. **ScrollView**: When content exceeds the screen space, ScrollView comes to the rescue. It provides vertical or horizontal scrolling for lists or lengthy views. Perfect for handling large amounts of data.

4. **TextInput**: Just like an <input> in web forms, TextInput lets users input text. Use it for everything from regular text to passwords or numeric input. Customize placeholders, secure text entry, and keyboard behavior.

5. **FlatList**: For efficient list rendering, FlatList shines. It optimizes performance by rendering only visible items from large datasets. Scrolling, item selection, and performance tweaks (key extractor, renderItem) are built-in.

6. **Image**: Display images with the Image component. It supports various formats (PNG, JPEG, GIF, SVG) and handles local or network-loaded images. Resize, crop, and cache for better performance.
